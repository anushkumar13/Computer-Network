# Computer Networks Notes and Concepts

Welcome to my **Computer Networks (CN)** learning repository!

This repository serves as my personal knowledge base where I document everything I'm learning about Computer Networks ‚Äî from the basic concepts to advanced topics.  
Each concept is explained in a simple and beginner-friendly manner, using **real-life analogies**, **simple language (sometimes Hinglish)**, and **visuals** to make the learning process easier and more enjoyable.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to **track my Computer Networks learning journey** and to build a strong understanding of how data communication happens over networks, including protocols, devices, and troubleshooting techniques.  
These notes are intended not only for me but also for anyone looking for clear, structured, and easily understandable explanations of Computer Networks concepts.
