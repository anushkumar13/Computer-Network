# What is a Load Balancer?

A **load balancer** is a solution that manages traffic. When many users are accessing an application or website at the same time, the load balancer ensures that the traffic is evenly distributed across different servers. This way, no single server becomes overloaded, and all servers work smoothly together.

---

## What Does a Load Balancer Do?

The load balancer distributes network or application traffic among multiple servers that hold the same data. During peak traffic times (when there is a lot of traffic), the load balancer becomes very important because it improves the application's reliability (how dependable it is) and enhances performance. If the traffic is divided equally among all servers, the load on each server is reduced, making the application faster and more stable.

---

## Why is Load Balancing Important?

Modern applications often need to handle millions of sessions simultaneously, delivering texts, videos, images, or other data quickly to each user. Because of this, most applications have many servers, each containing identical data.

A load balancer acts as a device or service positioned between the users and the group of servers. It works like an invisible helper that makes sure every server receives an equal share of traffic. This prevents servers from getting overloaded, keeps the application reliable, and improves the user experience.

---

## Session Persistence (Sticky Sessions)

An important concept related to load balancing is **session persistence**.

Sometimes, it is necessary for all requests from a single user to go to the same server during a session. For example, when a user is shopping online—adding items to their cart and making a payment—session persistence is required.

Without session persistence, requests might go to different servers. This means data has to be synchronized between servers, which can slow down performance. Session persistence keeps the connection between the user and one server for the entire session, ensuring a smooth and seamless shopping experience.

---

## Summary

- Load balancer distributes traffic equally across multiple servers.
- It makes applications fast, reliable, and stable.
- It prevents servers from getting overloaded.
- Session persistence ensures that all requests from a user during a session go to the same server, which is important in certain situations.

# Benefits of Load Balancing

Users and customers want to access their information quickly and perform transactions without interruptions, meaning they expect near real-time responses. If the response is slow or unreliable, especially when many users are accessing the system simultaneously (during peak demand), customers can get frustrated and may never return. When the demand or load on a server increases too much, that server or the entire server system can slow down or crash, causing problems.

Because of this, using a load balancer provides several important benefits:

---

## 1. Application Availability  
The application needs to be available at all times, whether the users are internal or external. If the application goes down, freezes, or runs very slowly, users waste their time and get frustrated, often moving to a competitor. A load balancer ensures that the application keeps running continuously and users do not face interruptions.

---

## 2. Application Scalability  
Imagine you run a ticketing company where tickets for a popular concert are available at a fixed date and time. Thousands of users visit your website at once to buy tickets. If you only have one server, it won’t be able to handle this demand, and the site may crash or slow down. But if you have a load balancer, it distributes the incoming requests across multiple servers, allowing more users to buy tickets smoothly. This way, you can easily scale your application to handle higher traffic.

---

## 3. Application Security  
Load balancers also improve security. When traffic is distributed among different backend servers, the chance of any single server being attacked reduces because the attack surface becomes smaller. If one server becomes vulnerable or compromised, the load balancer can redirect traffic to other safe servers.  
Additionally, load balancers help protect against DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks by smartly routing traffic so that no single server becomes overloaded.

---

## 4. Application Performance  
By enhancing security, optimizing uptime, and managing sudden spikes in demand, load balancers boost the overall performance of the application. This means the application runs smoothly and fast, performing as expected, providing users with a better experience.

---

## Summary  
Load balancing makes applications more **reliable**, **scalable**, **secure**, and **high-performing** — which is essential in today’s high-traffic and security-sensitive environments.

# Load Balancing Algorithms

Load balancing algorithms are responsible for distributing traffic across multiple servers. These algorithms work in two main ways: **static** and **dynamic**.

- **Static Load Balancing:** In this approach, the server's performance capacity information is known beforehand. The system is aware of how much capacity each server has and distributes the load accordingly.

- **Dynamic Load Balancing:** Here, the system makes decisions at runtime by analyzing the current load. When a request arrives, the system decides how much load to assign to which server based on the present conditions. This method is used in systems where the load keeps changing over time.

---

## Common Load Balancing Algorithms

### 1. Round Robin  
In this algorithm, traffic is distributed by rotating through a list of servers one by one. The first request goes to the first server, the second to the next, and so on, cycling continuously. This algorithm is static and often used with DNS (Domain Name System) to distribute traffic across servers.

### 2. Threshold  
A threshold value is set by the administrator in this algorithm. If the load on any server exceeds this threshold, incoming tasks or traffic are automatically redirected to other servers. This is also a static method.

### 3. Random with Two Choices  
This dynamic algorithm selects two random servers and then chooses the one with the least load based on criteria like Least Connections or Least Time. Essentially, it picks the server that is less busy or faster at that moment.

### 4. Least Connections  
New requests are sent to the server with the fewest active connections. This means the server currently handling the least load receives the next request. It also takes into account the server's computing capacity, selecting the server using the least resources.

### 5. Least Time  
Requests are sent to the server with the fastest response time and the fewest active connections. This algorithm combines the criteria of quick response and low load to make the best decision.

### 6. URL Hash  
This algorithm generates a hash value from the client’s request URL and uses that to forward the request to a specific server. If repeated requests come with the same URL, the load balancer sends them to the same server, allowing for cache hits and improved efficiency.

### 7. Source IP Hash  
A unique hash key is generated using the client’s source and destination IP addresses. This key binds the client to a specific server. If the session disconnects, when the client reconnects, it is redirected to the same server, maintaining session consistency.

### 8. Consistent Hashing  
Clients and servers are mapped onto a ring structure. Each server is assigned multiple points on the ring based on its capacity. When a client request arrives, it is hashed onto the ring and routed to the next available server. This dynamic algorithm is very useful when servers are frequently added or removed, as it allows easy redistribution of load.

---

## Summary  
- **Static algorithms** are used when server capacity is predefined and traffic is predictable.  
- **Dynamic algorithms** are suited for scenarios where the load fluctuates and decisions must be made at runtime about where to send the traffic.  

Each algorithm has its own use case, and the choice depends on the application’s load and requirements.

# How Does Load Balancing Work?

Load balancing works by handling user requests in two ways — either **statically** or **dynamically**. When a user sends a request, the load balancer decides which backend server should receive that request to fulfill it efficiently. If any server encounters a problem or goes down, the load balancer immediately redirects the traffic to other online servers to ensure the application runs smoothly without interruption.

---

## Examples of Load Balancing

### 1. Static Load Balancing Example  
Imagine a company hosting a website where most of the content is **static**, meaning it is mostly fixed and the traffic is predictable and consistent. In such a scenario, a static load balancer is ideal because the traffic patterns are known in advance. The company has two or more identical web servers, and the static load balancer distributes traffic evenly among them. This ensures all servers share the load equally, keeping the website running smoothly.

### 2. Dynamic Load Balancing Example  
Now imagine a company where traffic experiences surges, spikes, or drops — sometimes predictable, sometimes not. For such companies, dynamic load balancing is the best solution. Some examples include:

- An e-commerce retailer announcing a **Black Friday sale**, which suddenly attracts a huge amount of traffic.  
- A healthcare company booking **online vaccine appointments** during seasonal demand.  
- A government unemployment agency accepting **unemployment claims** on specific days each week.  
- A relief organization providing **quick online responses** during natural disasters.

In these situations, sometimes spikes and surges can be planned for, and sometimes they cannot. Dynamic load balancing helps by automatically adjusting to increased demand, ensuring users and customers always have access to the applications and resources without any interruptions.

# Different Types of Load Balancers

Load balancers come in different types based on their capabilities, and they operate at various layers of the network architecture called the **OSI model**. The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model has a total of 7 layers.

---

## OSI Model Layers Overview

- **Layers 1 to 3:** These layers are where network firewalls and basic network operations happen.  
  - **Layer 1:** Physical Layer (actual cables and hardware)  
  - **Layer 2:** Data Link Layer (manages data frames)  
  - **Layer 3:** Network Layer (routes data packets)

- **Layers 4 to 7:** Load balancing operates mainly in these layers.  
  - **Layer 4:** Transport Layer  
  - **Layer 5:** Session Layer  
  - **Layer 6:** Presentation Layer  
  - **Layer 7:** Application Layer

Generally, load balancers work mostly at **Layer 4** and **Layer 7**.

---

## Layer 4 Load Balancers

Layer 4 load balancers route traffic based on network and transport layer protocols like IP, TCP, UDP, and FTP.

- When a load balancer operates at the IP layer, it presents its own IP address as the website address to clients (destination address).
- When a request arrives, the load balancer changes the destination IP address to the IP address of the chosen backend server where the actual content or data resides.
- This means **Layer 4 load balancers forward requests at the network level without inspecting the content inside the application data**.

---

## Layer 7 Load Balancers

Layer 7 load balancers operate at the application layer and make routing decisions based on the content of the requests.

- They inspect HTTP headers, cookies, URLs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), SSL session IDs, and HTML form data to decide which server should handle the request.
- Layer 7 load balancers can make intelligent routing decisions based on specific parameters inside the application messages.
- An additional feature of Layer 7 load balancers is **content switching**, where requests are routed to different servers depending on the content of the request.

---

## Summary

In simple terms, **Layer 4 load balancers work at the network level**, forwarding requests based on IP and transport protocols without looking into application data, while **Layer 7 load balancers examine the application content and make smarter decisions about where to route requests** based on that information.

---

# Cloud-Based Load Balancers

Cloud-based load balancers are not just for controlling traffic to manage sudden traffic spikes or to make the best use of servers. They are **cloud-native load balancers** that also provide **predictive analytics**. This means they can anticipate future traffic bottlenecks—places where traffic may slow down or get stuck—and alert the company beforehand. This helps organizations optimize their IT solutions and improve their systems.

---

## Types of Cloud-Based Load Balancers

### 1. Application Load Balancing  
When companies rely heavily on the performance and availability of their applications, application load balancing helps them scale, streamline operations, and save costs. It ensures that applications run smoothly and can handle increased traffic efficiently.

### 2. Global Server Load Balancing  
When users or customers are spread across the globe, companies can improve load availability through global server load balancing. This technique directs users to the nearest server or endpoint, providing faster access and better user experience.

### 3. DNS Load Balancing  
This process involves configuring the Domain Name System (DNS) so that user requests are distributed across a group of servers. When a user sends a request to a domain, it automatically gets routed to different servers to balance the load.

### 4. Network Load Balancing  
Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs), which can be physical or virtual devices acting as proxies for servers, use network load balancing to manage their functionality. ADCs also use techniques like caching, compression, and SSL processing offloading to improve web application performance. ADCs usually sit in front of a group of servers and mediate client requests and responses, making the user see a single virtual server.

### 5. HTTP(S) Load Balancing  
This technique distributes traffic across multiple web or application server groups to ensure good resource utilization and balanced server loads.

### 6. Internal Load Balancing  
Internal load balancers are assigned to private subnets and do not have public IP addresses. They primarily work inside server farms, where multiple servers are part of the same network.

### 7. Diameter Load Balancing  
Diameter load balancers distribute signaling traffic among multiple servers within a network. This method is cost-effective when scaling the Diameter control plane (used in telecom networks) rather than the data transport layer. Diameter load balancing can be either static or dynamic.

In summary, these are the different types of cloud-based load balancers along with their simple explanations.

# Load Balancer Technology

Load balancers come in different types, which can be used individually or work together with cloud-native load balancer networks. Here are the important types of load balancer technologies:

---

## 1. Hardware Load Balancer  
A hardware load balancer is a physical device with a specialized operating system. It is programmed to distribute web traffic across multiple application servers. These devices are usually installed on-premises, meaning at the company’s own location.

## 2. Software Load Balancer  
A software load balancer works similarly to a hardware load balancer but runs as a software program. It keeps applications available across all kinds of traffic demands. Software load balancers use both static and dynamic load balancing to ensure there is no single point of failure in the system.

## 3. Virtual Load Balancer  
A virtual load balancer is a combination of hardware and software load balancers. It uses application delivery controller (ADC) software to help distribute network traffic across hardware backend servers.
