# Understanding Traditional ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a process used to map a known Layer 3 address (such as an IP address) to an unknown Layer 2 address (such as a MAC address). The main purpose of ARP is to correctly populate the Layer 2 header of a packet so that the packet can reach the next Network Interface Card (NIC).

### Who is the target of an ARP request?

- If a host is communicating with another host on the **same IP network**, the target of the ARP request is the **IP address of the other host**.
  
- If a host is communicating with a host on a **different IP network**, the target of the ARP request is the **IP address of the Default Gateway**.

### How is the ARP target decided in the case of a router?

- When a router is delivering a packet to a destination host, the ARP target is the **IP address of the destination host**.

- When a router is sending a packet to another router, the ARP target is the **interface IP address of the next-hop router**, which is found in the routing table.

### Why is this process important?

This ARP process ensures that packets reach the correct NIC, whether the communication is within the same network or across different networks.

# Detailed Explanation of the ARP Process in Simple English

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to find the MAC address for a known IP address. This process happens in two main steps: **Request** and **Response**.

---

## Step 1: ARP Request

First, the device that needs the MAC address of an IP (called the **initiator**, e.g., Host A) sends an **ARP Request**.

- The ARP Request is a **broadcast frame**, meaning it is sent to **all devices** on the network.
- This broadcast happens because the initiator does **not yet know** the MAC address of the target, so it cannot send a direct (unicast) message.
- All devices on the network receive this broadcast.
- Each device checks if the ARP Request is meant for them by looking at the target IP in the request.
- Devices that are **not the target** silently discard the request.
- The **target device** (e.g., Host B) replies back with an ARP Response to the initiator.

---

## Step 2: ARP Response

- The target device (Host B) already knows the initiator’s MAC address because it was included in the ARP Request.
- So, Host B sends the ARP Response as a **unicast** message — directly back to Host A.

### Important:
- The ARP Request contains the sender’s (Host A’s) MAC address.
- This allows the target device (Host B) to reply directly without broadcasting.

## Deep Dive into ARP Request Packet Structure

### What is an ARP Request?

- It is an ARP payload carried inside a Layer 2 frame (usually Ethernet in most networks).

### Ethernet Header has three main fields:

1. **Destination MAC Address**  
   This is `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` — the broadcast address, meaning all devices receive the message.  
   If a specific MAC was known, it would be a unicast, not a broadcast.

2. **Source MAC Address**  
   This is the sender’s MAC address (Host A’s MAC).

3. **EtherType**  
   This is `0x0806`, which signifies that the packet is an ARP packet.

---

### Why Padding is Needed?

- Ethernet frames must be at least 64 bytes.
- Header (Destination + Source + EtherType) = 14 bytes  
- ARP Payload = 28 bytes  
- FCS (Frame Check Sequence) = 4 bytes  
- Total so far = 46 bytes  
- To reach 64 bytes, 18 bytes of padding are added.

---

### ARP Payload Structure:

1. **Hardware Type & Protocol Type**  
   - Hardware Type: Ethernet (MAC)  
   - Protocol Type: IPv4

2. **Hardware Size & Protocol Size**  
   - MAC Address size: 6 bytes (48 bits)  
   - IPv4 Address size: 4 bytes (32 bits)

3. **Opcode**  
   - `1` = ARP Request  
   - `2` = ARP Response  
   In this case, Opcode = `1`.

4. **Sender & Target Addresses**  
   - Sender MAC & IP: Host A’s addresses (known)  
   - Target IP: Host B’s IP (the one we want to find MAC for)  
   - Target MAC: `00:00:00:00:00:00` (unknown at this point)

---

### Destination vs Target in ARP

- **Destination** = The MAC address to which the Ethernet frame is sent. In ARP Request, this is broadcast (`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`), so everyone receives it.  
- **Target** = The IP address in the ARP payload we want to resolve (Host B).

This distinction is important, especially when learning concepts like Proxy ARP or Gratuitous ARP later.

---

## Detailed Explanation of ARP Response

### What is an ARP Response?

- When a device (Host B) receives an ARP Request for its IP, it sends an ARP Response back to the requester (Host A).
- The response says:  
  *“Hello! I am the device with the IP you asked for, and here is my MAC address.”*

---

### ARP Response Packet Structure

Just like ARP Request, ARP Response has two parts: **Ethernet Header** and **ARP Payload**.

#### 1. Ethernet Header:

- **Destination MAC Address:** Host A’s MAC address (the requester).  
  This means the response is **unicast**, not broadcast.

- **Source MAC Address:** Host B’s MAC address (the responder).

- **EtherType:** `0x0806` indicating ARP packet.

- **Padding:** Same as ARP Request to make frame size minimum 64 bytes.

---

#### 2. ARP Payload:

- Hardware Type & Size: Ethernet (6 bytes)  
- Protocol Type & Size: IPv4 (4 bytes)  
- Opcode: `2` (this time it’s an ARP Response)  
- Sender MAC & IP: Host B’s addresses (the device replying)  
- Target MAC & IP: Host A’s addresses (the device that requested)

---

### Summary:

- **ARP Request:** Broadcast to all devices, asking “Who has this IP?”  
- **ARP Response:** Unicast reply to requester, providing MAC address.  
- Both packets have similar structure; Opcode differentiates request (`1`) from response (`2`).  
- ARP Response allows Host B to tell Host A its MAC address so communication can continue.

If you want visuals for better understanding, you can look for images titled “Ethernet Header (Response)” and “ARP Payload (Response)” on Pracnet.net or similar resources.

Now you have a clear understanding of how ARP Requests and Responses work, their packet structures, and their roles in network communication!
