# Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS Explained Simply

## What is HTTP?

HTTP stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol**. It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The term *HyperText* refers to text that is specially coded using HTML (HyperText Markup Language).

HTTP is a protocol used for transferring data between a web browser and a web server. When you open your browser and visit any website, you are indirectly using HTTP.

Through this protocol, text, images, videos, and other multimedia files are shared over the internet.

### Features of HTTP

- HTTP is an IP-based communication protocol that transfers data between a client (like a browser) and a server.
- Any type of content can be exchanged as long as both client and server are compatible.
- It is a request-response protocol: the client sends a request, and the server responds.

### HTTP Request and Response

- **HTTP Request:** When a client (usually a browser) asks the server for a resource, it sends an HTTP request. This request includes methods like GET, POST, headers, and sometimes a body with data.
- **HTTP Response:** The server replies to this request with a response that contains a status code (like 200 for success, 404 for not found), headers, and the actual content or an error message.

### How Does HTTP Work?

When the client needs information, it sends an HTTP request to the server. The server accepts this request and sends back a response with data or an error message. This communication happens on the default port **80**. Thatâ€™s why HTTP is associated with port 80.

## What is HTTPS?

HTTPS stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure**. It is basically the secure version of HTTP, where the data being transferred is encrypted. HTTPS uses the SSL/TLS protocol to provide secure communication.

Whenever you see `https://` in a website URL, it means the website is secure and the data transferred is encrypted.

### Features of HTTPS

- HTTPS encrypts the entire message, so both headers and request/response data remain secure.
- It uses trusted third parties to verify websites via digital certificates.
- HTTPS is widely used today because it keeps websites secure, especially for online banking, email, and shopping sites.

### How Does HTTPS Work?

When a client sends an HTTPS request, the client and server establish a secure connection using SSL/TLS. Both decide on encryption keys that encrypt the data.

This means that even if someone intercepts the data, they cannot read it because it is encrypted.

## Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS

| HTTP                                    | HTTPS                                         |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Full form: HyperText Transfer Protocol | Full form: HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure |
| URL starts with `http://`               | URL starts with `https://`                      |
| Uses port 80                           | Uses port 443                                 |
| Data transferred in plain text, insecure | Data is encrypted and secure                   |
| Works at the Application layer         | Works at the Transport layer                    |
| No encryption                         | Encryption enabled                             |
| Faster due to no encryption             | Slightly slower because of encryption overhead |
| Does not secure data                    | Encrypts data for secure transfer              |
| Used mostly for text, images, videos    | Used for secure data transfer                    |
| Simple and insecure protocol            | Secure protocol with authentication             |

## Conclusion

Both HTTP and HTTPS are protocols used for data transfer on the web. HTTP is simple but not secure, while HTTPS is secure because it encrypts and authenticates data.

If you want to transfer non-sensitive information, HTTP can be sufficient, but for online transactions or sensitive data, HTTPS is a must.

Today, HTTPS has become the standard for secure browsing and is highly recommended for all websites.
