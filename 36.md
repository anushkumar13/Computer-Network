## How Does an ATM Work?

Imagine you're a bank customer, and you need to withdraw money. Instead of going to the bank, you head to an ATM machine. Now, the ATM becomes your mini bank. Let's break down the entire process step by step:

---

### 1. **Insert the ATM Card**:
You insert your ATM card (either Debit or Credit card) into the machine.  
This card stores your bank details through a magnetic strip or chip.

The ATM card contains your Account Number, Bank Information, and Card Details, which the machine reads.

---

### 2. **Enter the PIN (Authentication)**:
The ATM asks you for your PIN (Personal Identification Number), which is a secret 4-digit code.

This step is crucial for security: it verifies that you are the rightful owner of the card, not someone else.

If the PIN is correct, the process moves forward. If it’s incorrect, the machine will warn you, and after a few attempts, the card may get blocked.

---

### 3. **Transaction Options Displayed**:
After entering the PIN, a menu with various options appears, such as:

- Cash Withdrawal
- Balance Inquiry
- Mini Statement
- PIN Change
- Fund Transfer (if allowed)

You choose "Cash Withdrawal."

---

### 4. **Connection with Bank Server (Verification)**:
The ATM machine then connects internally through a secure network/connection to your bank's server.

The ATM requests: "I need to withdraw this amount from account number X. Please check the balance and approve or decline."

---

### 5. **Balance Check and Approval**:
The bank server checks:

- Is there enough money in the account?
- Is the card valid?
- Is the requested withdrawal within the daily limit?

If everything is in order, the bank server sends a green signal to the ATM.

---

### 6. **Cash Dispensing Mechanism**:
Now, the ATM's Cash Dispensing Unit is activated:

Inside the machine, there is a cash cassette containing notes of ₹100, ₹200, ₹500, ₹2000, etc.

A note-counting roller scans each note, ensuring the correct amount and note quality.

Based on the amount you selected, the ATM dispenses the corresponding notes.

If a note is fake or stuck, the machine detects it and takes it back.

---

### 7. **Receipt and Update**:
The ATM gives you an option to:

- Print a receipt or not.

The receipt contains details like your balance and transaction time.

The bank server updates your account balance, subtracting the withdrawn amount.

---

### 8. **Card Return and Logout**:
At the final step:

- The machine returns your card.
- The session automatically logs out to ensure your account is secure.

## Technologies Behind the ATM

- **Card Reader**: Reads the card information.
- **Keypad**: Used for entering the PIN.
- **Display Screen**: Shows the transaction menu.
- **Cash Dispenser**: Dispenses the notes.
- **Receipt Printer**: Prints the transaction slip.
- **Secure Network Connection**: Connects to the bank server.
- **Software + Bank Database**: Accesses your account for transactions.

## Bonus: What if Cash Isn’t Dispensed but Money is Deducted?

This situation can occur due to:

- A delayed response from the bank server.
- An error in the note dispenser.
- Network disconnection.

In such cases, the bank automatically reverses the transaction, or you can file a complaint. The money is usually refunded within 7 working days.

## Summary: ATM is a Mini Bank

The ATM reads your card, authenticates your identity with the PIN, gets permission from the bank server, and if everything is in order, it dispenses cash. This entire process happens through a combination of machines, software, and the bank’s network.
