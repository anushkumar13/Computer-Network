# What is an API Gateway?

An **API Gateway** is a software layer or server that acts as an entry point between clients (like mobile apps, web apps) and backend services (such as microservices, databases). When a client requests data from a backend service, the request first passes through the API Gateway.

Its main purpose is to manage multiple backend services, provide security, route requests, and offer a centralized access point.

## How Does an API Gateway Work?

Whenever a client sends a request, it does not go directly to the backend service. Instead, the request first reaches the API Gateway.

The API Gateway analyzes the request and then routes it to the correct backend service. After receiving the response from the backend, the API Gateway sends the response back to the client.

## Important Functions of an API Gateway

- **Request Routing:** The API Gateway decides which backend service should handle the clientâ€™s request.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** It verifies whether the client is authorized to make the request, enhancing security.
- **Rate Limiting:** Controls how many requests can be made within a certain time frame to prevent server overload.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes requests across multiple service instances to balance the load.
- **Data Transformation:** Converts data formats if there is a difference between client and backend expectations.
- **Caching:** Stores frequently requested data to provide faster responses.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Keeps records of all requests and responses to track performance and troubleshoot issues.

## Why is an API Gateway Important?

When you have many microservices, each service has its own URL. If the client has to know all these URLs, it increases complexity.

An API Gateway provides a centralized access point, making it easier for clients to access all services.

This improves security, performance, and simplifies system management.

## Simple Example

Imagine you have an online shopping app with different backend services:

- **User Service:** Handles login, signup.
- **Product Service:** Provides product details.
- **Order Service:** Manages orders.

Instead of the client calling each of these services separately, it sends requests to the API Gateway. The API Gateway decides which service should handle each request and returns the response to the client.

## Summary

An API Gateway is middleware that acts as a middleman between clients and multiple backend services. It routes requests, performs security checks, balances load, and makes system management easier.
