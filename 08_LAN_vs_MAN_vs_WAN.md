# Understanding LAN, MAN, and WAN: A Friendly Story

Imagine you are a network engineer and you have to set up networks in three very different places: a school, a city-wide company, and a multinational corporation (MNC) operating across countries. Let‚Äôs see how these networks differ!

## üìç LAN (Local Area Network) ‚Äî Network Inside a School or Office

Your first project is to set up a network inside a school. Here, you only need to connect the computers within the school building ‚Äî like the computer lab, principal‚Äôs office, staff room, etc.

- **Scope:** Small, limited to a building or campus.  
- **Ownership:** Usually owned by a single organization (e.g., school‚Äôs IT department).  
- **Speed:** Very fast with minimal propagation delay (data travels quickly).  
- **Use Cases:** Schools, colleges, hospitals, offices.  
- **Example:** A WiFi router inside the school connecting all devices.

## üèôÔ∏è MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) ‚Äî Network Covering an Entire City

Your next task is for a banking company with branches all over a city. They want all branches connected through one network.

- **Scope:** Covers an entire city or a large town.  
- **Ownership:** Can be owned by one organization or shared among several.  
- **Cost:** More expensive due to more cables and devices.  
- **Function:** Connects multiple LANs spread across the city.  
- **Example:** The internal network connecting different SBI bank branches across Delhi.

---

## üåç WAN (Wide Area Network) ‚Äî Network Covering Countries or the Whole World

Finally, you are working for an international company with headquarters in India and branches in the USA, UK, and Japan. LAN or MAN won‚Äôt work here.

- **Scope:** Very large, covering countries and even continents.  
- **Technology:** Uses public networks like PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) or satellites.  
- **Cost:** Very expensive, usually operated by multiple organizations together.  
- **Speed:** Higher propagation delay because of long distances.  
- **Example:** The Internet is itself a WAN.

## Quick Summary Table

| Network Type | Scope           | Ownership          | Cost   | Use Case                      |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------|------------------------------|
| **LAN**      | Building/Campus | Private (single)   | Low    | Schools, offices, colleges   |
| **MAN**      | City/Town       | Shared or private  | Medium | City banks, cable TV networks |
| **WAN**      | Country/World   | Shared or private  | High   | MNCs, internet, global firms |

This is how LAN, MAN, and WAN differ, each serving a unique purpose based on scale, cost, and ownership!

# Difference Between LAN, MAN, and WAN Explained Simply

Imagine you are a network architect with three projects: one for a school, one for a city-level company, and one for a global company. Comparing these three will help us understand the difference between LAN, MAN, and WAN easily, using real-life examples.
