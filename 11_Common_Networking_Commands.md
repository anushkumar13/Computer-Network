# Introduction to Networking Commands

Operating systems come with built-in tools that can be used via the command line to help understand and fix network-related issues. These tools are called **networking commands**. They are very important for network administrators to troubleshoot network problems efficiently.

# Top 9 Networking Commands

Here are nine of the most commonly used networking commands that help diagnose and resolve network issues:

### 1. Ping Command
The **ping** command is used to check whether one network device (like a computer or router) can connect to another device.

When you type `ping` followed by the IP address or hostname of the target device in the command prompt or terminal, it tests if the connection is working properly.

Ping uses the **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**, which sends an “echo request” message to the target device, and if the device responds with an “echo reply,” it means the connection is good.

For example, if your office internet is not working, you can use the ping command to check whether the problem is inside your office network or with the internet service provider.

### 2. NetStat Command
The **netstat** command provides detailed information about TCP/IP connections, such as active connections, listening ports, and protocol statistics.

It is useful for understanding the current network status and seeing which connections are open.

---

### 3. Ipconfig Command
The **ipconfig** command displays the IP configuration details of your device, such as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

Using `ipconfig /all` shows more detailed information including DNS and DHCP configurations, which helps in diagnosing network problems.

---

### 4. Hostname Command
Every computer or device on a network has a unique name called the **hostname**. This name can be alphabetic or alphanumeric and helps identify the device on the network.

Using the hostname command shows the device’s name, and with additional options, you can see related details like the domain name or IP address associated with the hostname.

---

### 5. Tracert Command
The **tracert** (or traceroute) command shows the path a network packet takes from the source device to the destination. It also reveals how many hops or devices the packet passes through.

This helps in understanding where delays or failures happen along the network route.

---

### 6. Nslookup Command
The **nslookup** command is used to query the DNS (Domain Name System) server and find information such as the domain name’s IP address or the DNS server details.

It is useful for troubleshooting DNS-related problems.

---

### 7. Route Command
The **route** command lets you view and manipulate the routing table of your device.

The routing table determines how packets are directed from one subnet to another. You can view the current routes or add, delete, and modify them using this command.

---

### 8. ARP Command
**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** helps map IP addresses to physical MAC addresses, which are necessary for data delivery within a local network.

Using the `arp -a` command shows the list of IP addresses and their corresponding MAC addresses, assisting in diagnosing communication problems.

---

### 9. Path Ping Command
The **pathping** command combines the features of ping and tracert.

It provides detailed statistics about latency and packet loss at each hop between the source and destination.

Since it collects detailed information, the command may take some time to complete.

# Conclusion

In this article, we have covered nine essential networking commands: **Ping, Netstat, Ipconfig, Hostname, Tracert, Nslookup, Route, ARP,** and **Path Ping**. These commands help quickly diagnose and troubleshoot network issues.

Practicing these commands will make it easier for you to understand and solve networking problems effectively.
